## Developer's guide

In order to run this role as a developper you will need an environnement meeting the following requirements:
- docker, python3, ansible, ansible-lint, molecule

The following show the setup process for an Ubuntu 22.04 environnement but you can easily replicate this on any system that can meet the specified requirements.

- Docker installation: checkout the [official tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for installing docker.
```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release 
	
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```
After installation make sure to run this command to add your current user to the `docker` group so that you can run the docker command without using sudo.
```bash
sudo usermod --append $USER --groups docker
```

- rsync, Python 3, ansible and molecule setup

```bash
sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-pip python3-venv rsync
git clone <link-to-this-repository> ansible-role-mariadb
cd ansible-role-mariadb
python3 -m venv env # Create a virtual environnement
source env/bin/activate # Activate the environnement
pip3 install ansible ansible-lint molecule[docker] # Install the python packages in the virutal environnement
```

After setting up the environnement you can use molecule to test the role as you wish. If you are not very familiar with molecule, checkout the following table for some basic commands you can run against this role.

Command                                            | description                                                                             |
---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
molecule list                                      | List the available scenarios for testing                                                |
molecule converge -s cluster                       | Create the necessary docker containers and run this scenarios to set them up.           |
molecule converge -s default                       | Create the necessary containers for the default scenario and run this role agains them  |
molecule login -s cluster --host node1             | Log in to the node1 container from the default scenario                                 |
molecule login -s default --host debian11          | Log in to the debian11 container from the default scenario                              |
molecule test -s cluster --destroy never or always | Run the tests from the cluster scenario on the created containers                       |
molecule test -s default --destroy never or always | Run the tests from the default scenario on the created containers                       |
molecule destroy -s cluster                        | Remove all resources created for the cluster scenario                                   |
molecule destroy -s default                        | Remove all resources created for the default scenario                                   |

When you're done testing the role you can deactivate the python virtual environnement by running `deactivate`.


## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the role, this includes new variables, 
   useful file locations, etc...
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
